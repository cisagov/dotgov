This is a custom widget for USWDS's comboboxes. 
USWDS comboboxes are basically just selects with a "usa-combo-box" div wrapper.
We can further customize these by applying attributes to this parent element, 
for now we just carry the attribute to both the parent element and the select.

<div class="usa-combo-box"     
{% for name, value in widget.attrs.items %}
    {{ name }}="{{ value }}"
{% endfor %}

    {% include "django/forms/widgets/select.html" %}
</div>
