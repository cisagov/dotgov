# Restoring a Cloud.gov Database

Documentation for restoring from a backup can be found [here](https://gist.github.com/markdboyd/8f20f9bdcfb591febaa838a50d0deb23)

Notes:

- Ensure that all necessary tools are downloaded before following the instructions
- The version of pg_dump used must match the version on prod
- Many of the tools needed may be inaccessible on CISA devices, but can be easily installed into a Docker container.
